There was whooping in our alley when I woke up, and that made me smile: today would not be boring.

Everyone was out there. Waving and shouting and banging on drums, and holding the flags of our nation. I thought how it would be nice if we had some large space that we could all go to and gather in, but the biggest space in the compound was the main alley which ran down its center from north to south.

<ul><li>[[Look around]]</li></ul>

:: Look around
I looked around and noticed Josiah riding up on top of a bigger boy's shoulders, yelling and waving his flag. He saw me and let out a whoop. I smiled and waved back at him. 

Father came to the door then and put his hand on my shoulder. 

[[Ishmael, this is a great day]]

:: Ishmael, this is a great day
He had said that many times already, but I didn't mind. He told me that the leaders of our people were visiting us. Not our greatest leader—who was too busy fighting our war to come to the compound—but some of his lieutenants.

We paraded through the streets for a while, just hollering and waving our flags and being patriotic. Eventually we managed to squeeze into the central alleyway where everyone was gathered. The visitors were up on a rooftop looking down at the crowd and shouting about hope and God and reclaiming Pine Nut Valley. They were wearing guns, and every once in a while one of them would fire a volley up into the air, which made everyone cheer especially loud. <<linkreplace "They shouted and we cheered." transition>>They shouted and we cheered, <<linkreplace "they shouted and we cheered." transition>><<timed 3s>><<goto "Then one of the soldiers raised his arms">><</timed>>they shouted and we cheered, until the sun started to set.<</linkreplace>><</linkreplace>>

<span class="typed">
Ishmael was a good boy: he obeyed his father, and he loved his mother, and he was an example to his brothers and sisters. He was a loyal boy: he made friends for keeps, and he would defend them when they needed him. He was also an intelligent boy: he wished to learn, and had a special love for mathematics: he dreamed of attending university some day in the future, and becoming a doctor.

<<set $next_passage = 'puppet_4'>>

One day, however, Ishmael's father had to explain to Ishmael that he would never be able to be a doctor, because the enemy controlled their country and had barred the roads that would allow Ishmael to travel to university.

<<set $next_passage = 'puppet_5'>>
<span class="typed">
Ishmael was disappointed to hear what his father had to tell him, but he was stout of heart, and determined that he would live a happy life in spite of his inability to fulfill his dreams: after all, he had his friends to play with, and his family to love.
</span>

:: puppet_5 [nobr puppet-show auto-advance]
<<set $next_passage = 'puppet_6'>>
<span class="typed">
But one day the enemy came with a bulldozer and told Ishmael's family that they would have to leave their home, because the land was no longer theirs. Ishmael's father asked how this could be, since their family had deeds that went back three hundred years. The enemy would not answer him, and only asked that they step aside so that the house could be bulldozed. Ishmael's mother would not step aside, and so they bulldozed her into the ground with the house.
</span>

:: puppet_6 [nobr puppet-show auto-advance]
<<set $next_passage = 'puppet_7'>>
<span class="typed">
Ishmael observed all of this and wondered why it was happening. His mother was gone, and his house was gone, and he learned that his friends' houses were gone too.

<span class="typed">
Now Ishmael, above all else, was a brave boy, and he determined that the purpose of his life was to fight the enemy however he could: in this way he could live out his love for his mother, and his loyalty to his friends. So he threw rocks at the bulldozer of the enemy. And the enemy shot him, and he died.
