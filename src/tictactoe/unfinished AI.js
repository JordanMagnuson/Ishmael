// // Has corner and corner. The computer simply blocks any win condition of the player. The player will have win conditions in all directions. The computer must block them. If this leads to a corner play the
// // computer will win on TURN 7

// // Has corner and middle but can't win. The computer blocks any player win if it has to.
// //After this there are 2 cells. They are -3 or + 1 of the corner cell. Playing either will result in a 2 way win condition.

// // TURN 7
// // Attempts win. Blocks losss. If none is possible then random play as game will draw no matter what is played.

// //TURN 9

// // Very simple. The computer plays the remaining cell.
